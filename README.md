## Final Conclusion:
To boost pizza sales, focus on promoting Classic and Chicken pizzas, which are top performers. Target peak hours (12–1 PM and 4–8 PM) on weekends, especially Friday and Saturday. Emphasize large-sized pizzas in campaigns, as they generate the highest sales. Prioritize marketing bestsellers like The Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken Pizza, while considering strategies to improve sales of low performers like The Brie Carre.
